            <p>
              We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving
              force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the
              people we make it for.

              Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of
              us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of
              cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some
              are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What
              connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills
              and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the
              future of music culture.

              Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
              people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned
              that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are
              richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set
              of perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but
              opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.

              Alongside an internal training program, employees are actively
              supported in acquiring new knowledge and skills, and coached on
              applying these in their daily work. In addition, staff-organized
              development and music salons are a chance to discuss new
              technologies, production techniques and best practices.

              comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, as well as
              generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible,
              but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings
